When you have to write a blog-entry, a documentation-page or
any other kind of content you may need to link other content
on the site.
To do so, we open a new browser-tab with our site, where we
search the content, we want to link. Then copy the url we
get, go back to our node-edit-form, create the html for a
link and paste the url to the href-attribute.
I think, this cant be the way. So i created this module.

After installing it, you have new admin-settings on this
page: /admin/settings/node2node
Here you choose which nodetype should integrate the
feature.

When you create a new node from one the types you choosed
here, you will find a link called: node2node-link. When
you click it, a dialogbox opens up which shows a view.
When you click a link in this view, the page wont be
called, but its html-code will be pasted to the bodytext
of your node.

This module is maintained by the drupaletics-dev-team,
and developed by chaosprinz.
Its under the gnu-license. Look under licence.txt for
